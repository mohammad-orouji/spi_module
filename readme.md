this project is written and tested for z-turn board.
For the MOSI path from master to slave, we take data from a counter and then send it to the slave module by the master module, and the data is collected in the slave module as a multi-bit data, then it is sent to the error checker module for data verification.
The same procedure exists for MISO, with the difference that it first waits until the master data is completely sent, then it sends its data to the master.
